# Task 2 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

📌 Project Overview  
This task focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a books dataset.
The goal is to understand the data structure, identify patterns, analyze price and rating distribution, and prepare insights for further analysis or visualization.

Rows: 100  
Columns: Title, Price, Rating, Availability, Product_Page  

🔍 Key Steps Performed  
- Loaded and explored dataset (shape, info, duplicates, missing values)  
- Cleaned data (converted price & ratings to numeric formats)  
- Created useful new columns  
- Visualized:  
  - 📊 Price distribution  
  - ⭐ Rating distribution  
- Generated summary statistics
